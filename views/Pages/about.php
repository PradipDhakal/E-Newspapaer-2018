                    <p>

                        Cable News Network (CNN) is an American pay television news channel and a subsidiary of AT&T's
                        WarnerMedia.[1] CNN was founded in 1980 by
                        American media proprietor Ted Turner as a 24-hour cable news channel.[2] Upon its launch, CNN
                        was the first television channel to provide 24-hour news
                        coverage,[3] and was the first all-news television channel in the United States.[4]
                    </p>

                    <p> We have numerous affiliates, CNN primarily broadcasts from the Time Warner Center in New York
                        City, and studios
                        in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. Its headquarters at the CNN Center in Atlanta is only used
                        for weekend programming. CNN is sometimes
                        referred to as CNN/U.S. (or CNN Domestic[5]) to distinguish the American channel from its
                        international sister network, CNN International.
                        As of August 2010, CNN is available in over 100 million U.S. households.[6] Broadcast coverage
                        of the U.S.
                        channel extends to over 890,000 American hotel rooms,[6] as well as carriage on subscription
                        providers throughout Canada.
                        As of July 2015, CNN is available to about 96,374,000 pay-television households (82.8% of
                        households with at least one television set) in the United States.
                        [7] Globally, CNN programming airs through CNN International, which can be seen by viewers in
                        over 212 countries and territories.[8] </p>

                    <p> CNN launched its website, CNN.com (initially an experiment known as CNN Interactive), on August
                        30, 1995. The site attracted growing interest over its first decade and is now one of the most
                        popular news websites in the world. The widespread growth of blogs, social media and
                        user-generated content have influenced the site, and blogs in particular have focused CNN's
                        previously scattershot online offerings, most noticeably in the development and launch of CNN
                        Pipeline in late 2005.

                        In April 2009, CNN.com ranked third place among online global news sites in unique users in the
                        U.S., according to Nielsen/NetRatings; with an increase of 11% over the previous year.[88]

                        CNN Pipeline was the name of a paid subscription service, its corresponding website, and a
                        content delivery client that provided streams of live video from up to four sources (or
                        "pipes"), on-demand access to CNN stories and reports, and optional pop-up "news alerts" to
                        computer users. The installable client was available to users of PCs running Microsoft Windows.
                        There was also a browser-based "web client" that did not require installation. The service was
                        discontinued in July 2007,
                        and was replaced with a free streaming service.</p>
